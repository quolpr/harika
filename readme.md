## Key features

- Offline first — use it with your mobile or desktop, and see changes on the fly; even when you are offline, it all got synced when you will get online back.
- Scalable — notes are loading on-demand, so it doesn't matter how large your knowledge base will be.
- Instant startup time — no matter how extensive your database is.
- Mobile support — you will have the same experience as with the desktop version.
- Great performance — we did a huge work to achieve smooth U, but there is still a lot of space to work.
- Open source — you can always host Harika on your server, including the sync server too.
